          )AYLIGHT SAVING
          TO GIVE WORKERS
          TIME FOR PLAY
          'hysicians Believe Move Will
          Do Much to Better the
          Health of Many
          Men who like the great outdoors.'
          ho like to leave the offices for a
          alk. a little fishing trip nnd a round
          f golf—to-day praised the passage 1
          t the daylight-saving bill by Con- j
          ress.
          Physicians here to-day also were j
          f the opinion that tho new sched- j
          le. to become effective Easter Sun
          ay, will do much for thd healUi j
          fa great number of workers who'
          or the first time will have a chance
          3 get out into the parks and fields,
          fter a day's work.
          Businessmen generally tli rough-
          out the city this afternoon declared
          that the changing of hours would
          be accomplished without interrupt
          ing or hurting trade. It was said
          that tho change would mean little
          or nothing to the larger mills ahd
          munitions plants, where three shifts
          of men now ure engaged in working
          throughout the twenty-four hours, j
          No difficulty will be experienced in
          trolley car schedules, it was said at
          the offices of the Harrisburg and
          'cross-river traction companies and
          the turning of the watch will do
          the trick. i
          Theaters, railroads and every bus-
          iness house in the city will operate
          according to the now schedule, and,
          therefore, it was pointed out, there
          can be 110 confusion after a man
          has once reset his watch.
          Summed up, Mr, Littlefleld says:
          "The bill provides tor an hour
          advance in standard time at 2
          o'clock a. in. on the last Sunday
          in .March of each yefcr and at
          a. m. the lust Sunday in October
          uie standard time shall be retarded
          one hour. Eleven countries have
          adopted the summer daylight sav-
          ing plan. The first was Germany,
          then Great Britain, France, Austria-
          Hungary, Italy, Sweden, Denmark,
          Norway, Holland, Portugal and Au-/
          stralla. London, England, saved
          200,000 tons of coal during a sum
          mer. In England in five and one
          half months $12,000,000 in coal '.vere
          saved, and In France $10,000,000. It
          is estimated that in the United States
          $10,000,000 can be saved in light
          bills. The hour of daylight con
          served by the proposed law can be
          used by industrial workers throug
          out America for gardening and agri
          cultural work. This will be a most
          important gain. We are sure of a
          great shortage in farm labor this
          summer and something must be done
          to offset the probable loss in pro
          duction of farm products. The hour
          saved for daylight every day in April.
          May, June, July, August, September
          and October will be of inestimable
          value in stimulating the dwellers in
          cities and towns to interest them
          selves in the production of garden
          truck."
          PASS DAYLIGHT
          SAVING BILL;
          AWAITS WILSON
          Clocks All Over Country Will
          Be Turned Ahead
          One Hour
          Wusliington, Mar. 16—The House
          of Representatives, by 252 to 40. yes
          terday passed the Senate daylight
          saving bill, under the terms of
          which, when it receives the signa
          ture of President Wilson, it'will be
          required that all the clocks in the
          United States be turned ahead one
          hour at 2 a. m. 011 Sunday, March
          31, and remain advanced one hour
          until 2 a. m. on the last Sunday in
          October.
          Under the bill parsed by the
          Senate the limit was, fixed as the
          last Sunday in September. The
          House amendment extending the
          daylight saving one month was
          adopted upon representations by-
          Fuel Administrator Garfield that a
          great amount of l'uel would be con
          served thereby. It is expected that
          the Senate will concur in the amend
          ment to-morrow.
          Five standard time zones for th
          United States will be fixed by the
          Government, according to the bill,
          and it is made mandatory upon the
          railroads to follow the standard
          time.
          By the passage of the bill, tho
          United States joins with England,
          France, Switzerland, Portugal and
          the three Scandinavian countries in
          adopting a method of economy and
          efficiency first taken by Germany
          during the early days of the war.
          Millions of tons .of coal have been
          saved in these countries, it was
          stated to the House to-day by the
          supporters of the measure, by the
          simple means of turning the clock
          ahead over a period of five or six
          months a year.
          England reports a saving of 12,-
          000,000 tons up to date. Several
          Representatives who espoused tha
          bill admitted that when it was first
          proposed they considered it silly.
          But, they said, when they came to
          examine its virtues they fell enthu
          siastically behind it.
          Provided the President signs it,
          and there is little doubt that he will
          do so quickly, the daylight-saving
          bill will have the effect of turning
          us all out of bed an hour earlier
          than we have been accustomed-to
          arise and of sending us back again
          accordingly. The use of fuel at
          night will be conserved by the clos
          ing of establishments at 11 o'clock
          which ordinarily do business until
          12 o'clock. By the clock on the wall
          it will still be 12 o'clock, but by
          the moral conviction it. will be 11.
          Officials of the Chamber of Com
          merce and the Bourse, two of the
          many local organisations which car
          ried the light for the daylight-sav
          ing bill into the very halls of Con
          fess. were jubilant on receipt of
          the news that the legislation was
          so near. Ernest T. Trigg, president
          of the Chamber of Commerce, said:
          "This is very gratifying to us. By
          a readjusting of working hours the
          war industries will be speeded up
          materially and more time for the
          cultivation of war gardens will re
          sult."

          ItlGHI
          These charts show vividly how the daylight saving plan will give j
          everybody more "free hour#" of daylight. You've heard this: "Well,!
          there are just so many hours of daylight in a day and you can't change j
          'em." But wait?the daylight hours before your work-day itarts are
          so-called "wasted hours"?you ?leep them away or spend them getting
          ready to go to work. The daylight saving plan merely "shifts" an
          hour of daylight to the "free hours" after work, when you can use it.
          The tables is based on the average June day and the workday from
          8 to 5 includes an hour for lunch.
          Moving the Clock.
          The clock will be set forward one
          hour at 2 a. m., March SI, according
          to the House bill. At the same hour
          on October 27, the clock will be set
          back.
          The present standard time rones
          will remain in effect.
          Both changes will take place on
          Sunday mornings so that the least
          possible wrench may be given to
          the industrial fabric of the nation.
          But even at that on the railroads
          alone there will be some 1.000 pas
          senger trains and 5.000 trains run
          ning on the tracks when the change
          comes, and 1,698.SIS railroad clocks
          and watches must be set forward
          to keep traffic moving and prevent
          accidents. In 1883. however, a sim-
          ilar change from local to standard
          time went into effect on 100,000
          miles of railroad without a single
          mishap.
          Benefits of Plan.
          The following benefits will be
          reaped by the daylight-saving plan:
          Saving of one to one and a half
          million tons of coal per year, ac
          cording to Fuel Administration es
          timates.
          Increased food production by sub
          urban gardeners.
          Less traffic accidents.
          Improvement in health of all the
          people. More fresh air. Women
          workers will return from work in
          daylight.

          Clocks all over the oountry will
          be set ahead one hour, beginning
          March 31, under the so-called day
          light-saving bill, pessed yesterday by
          the House, 252 to 40.
          Senator Calder, author of the
          ure In the upp?r braftch iftf Congress,
          said the House amendments would
          be agreed to, so that a conference
          would not be necessary.
          Provisions of Bill.
          The bill provides that at 2 o'clock
          p. m. on the last Sunday In March
          each year, clocks all over the country
          which affect any operations of the
          Federal government, or railroads,
          i shall be set ahead one hour. At 2
          j o'clock p. m., the last Sunday in Oc
          j tober of each year, they are to be
          i retarded one hour.
          j All business relating in any way
          to the Federal government will be
          conducted on the time set. Further

          tMe various sones as United fctates

          Standard Central time, etc.
          Inasmuch as commercial and labor
          organizations the country over have
          petitioned for the bill, Congress ex
          pects a general agreement with the
          law everywhere. The five sones are
          to be fixed by order of the Inter
          state Commerce Commission. But it
          Is directed in the bill to have "due
          regard" for present railroad classi
          fications. The unofficial understand
          ing is that no important change is
          to be made in present arrangements.

          Daylight Saving Is Simplicity Itself
          How Ben Franklin s Idea Conceived in 1784, Just Made Into Law Here, Will Affect
          Folks After Easter and Save Millions to the Nation
          10
          By WM. ARCHIBALD FERGUSON,
          Secretary of the National Daylight Sar
          ins Association.
          ON Ihc coming Apwl 1 more people
          in the United Slates will probably
          be April fool vietims than on any previ
          ous or future April 1, for Congress lias
          decreed that at 2 o'clock on the morning
          of March 31 the hands of the clock shall
          be turned forward one hour; in other
          words, the United States will then begin
          to live under the davlight saving plan,
          and doubtless thousands will forget to
          make the change.
          May Wait Lone for Dinner.
          If lie starts for home at the tame hour
          as usual and has not during the day tele
          phoned his wife to turn the clock ahead
          be will have a long wail tor dinner. One
          thing Is certain, hotvivcr. that before he
          retires that night crry member of his
          household will know that the daylight pav
          ing plan is in effect and that the people
          of the United States are living an hour
          ahead of sun time.
          The daylight sating idea U almost as
          Id as the United States it-elf and our
          country can rightly claim the credit for
          all the many advantages which will act-rue
          from it, not only in this country bat also
          in those countries which anticipated the
          United Slates in its adoption, for it was
          Benjamin Pranklm who Iirst conceited
          the idea.
          Soon thereafter in the Jtwrnal Je
          Faris he publL-hcd an article, later ap
          pearing among his es-ays under the title
          4An Economical Project," which further
          elaborated the advantages of daylight sav
          ing; namely, of "Turning the clock for
          ward an hour" so that everybody would
          live one hour longer by davlight and one
          hour less by artificial light.
          BENJAMIN FRANKLIN
          jr FROM THE ENGRAVING OF THE DUPLESSIS' PORTRAIT OF 1778
          Noted American philosopher is the father of daylight saving.
          The chief benefits of the plan, as
          proved by the experience of England,
          France and other European countries
          where it has been in force, may be gen
          erally summarized under three heads:
          Eirst General health of all people
          benefited by reason of an added hour of
          daylight in the late afternoon, which has
          been and will be u-ed for outdoor recre
          ation and exercise.
          Second Increased production of food
          stuffs through the stimulating cultivation
          of home gardening.
          Third Money saved in lighting bills:
          each householder will burn artificial light
          one hour less each day, provided, of
          course, he continues his usual habits of
          retiring at night.
          The report of the summertime commit
          tee appointed by the British Parliament
          in September, 1!1G, to inquire into the
          social and economic results of the sum
          mertime act shows that the extra hour of
          dat light was generally ucd for the pur-po-e
          of outdoor recreation and pursuit's,
          and, in particular, for the cultivation of
          home gardening.
          The athletic dubs reported that the
          cricketers, bowlers, golfers and tennii
          players took full advantage of the extra
          hour of light, and swimming pools and
          playgrounds were utilized to full capac
          ity. Iu view of the national agitation last
          year, which is being renewed now, for
          the cultivation of home gardens to in
          crease the production of food the inaugu
          ration of the daylight saving plan iu this
          country will undoubtedly very greatly
          stimulate home gardening, particularly in
          the neighborhood of the great cities. In
          New York city alone there are 1,000.000
          daily commuters. Should only one-half
          of them use the extra hour of daylight
          which the plan will give in cultivating
          home gardens there will bo 3,000,000 extra
          hours utilized weekly in gardening and
          during the seven summer months in which
          the plan is in operation 2,000,000 days of
          extra work and time will be spent by
          these 500,000 commuters in the cultiva
          tion of gardens.
          The saving in lighting bills ami in fuel
          u.-ed for producing electricity and gas
          wdl be tremendous. Public Service En
          gineer Robert L. Bruuct of Providence,
          If. I., has carefully estimated this saving
          and fixed the amount during the period of
          live mouths, which the plan originally
          contemplated, at $-10,000,000, and tiie
          amount of coal sated at 1,000,000 tons.
          This sating will he unitersal as every
          hou-eholder will u-e one hour les- of aili
          licial light daily under the new plan.
          Other additional benefits will be the re
          duction of traffic accidents due to Ici-cncd
          tran-poriation of pa'.sengers under arti
          ficial light, reduction of the danger of eye
          strain on account of the lessened amount
          of reading and work done under artiticial
          light and more lime for open air military
          drilling.
          The davlight sating hill as signed by
          President Wilson on March 19 provides
          lhat the plan shall go into effect at 2
          o'clock antemeridian time on Sunday
          morning, March 31, at which time clocks
          and watches, probably upon a signal
          flashed from the United States Naval
          Observatory at Washington will be
          turned ahead one hour. Comparatively
          very few individuals, unless by design,
          will be conscious w hen the change is
          made. "This hour was selected by reason
          of the fact that at 2 o'clock in the morn
          ing the number of railroad trains actually
          en route is smallest,

          Daylight Saving is
          Law Of Land.
          r- Don't make any dates for 2:30
          t, Sunday morning, March 31, be.
          st cause there ain't gonna be no
          ill sich animal. In fact, there will
          le be no 2 o'clock. At 60 seconds
          le after 1:59 it will not be 2 o'clock
          but 3 o'clock. Similarly, if you
          contemplate any sort of engage
          ment, business or social, for 1:30
          Sunday morning Oct. 27, you
          g had better make plain which
          v "1:30" you mean, because there
          n is going to be two of 'em on that
          y day. Exactly 60 seconds after
          1:59 a. m. Sunday morning, Oct.
          27, it will not be 2 o'olook, but
          1 o'clock again.
          That is what President Wils'i
          n did Tuesday, March 19, when he
          n affixed his signature to the day
          light bill which had already been
          passed by congress. As a result,
          the Muniversally accepted plaint
          d that life is growing more com
          plex every day, has another sup
          porting argument.
          However there is going to be
          very little confusion, after all.
          Just remember to do this, and
          you'll be all right:
          Before you go to bed on the
          night of Saturday, March 30, set
          every watch, alarm clock, grand.
          father's clock, cuckoo clock or
          other timepiece in the entire
          house, one hour ahead.' This is
          going be done in every house
          hold in the entire United States.
          On the morning of Sunday, March
          31 when you awake, the change
          will have been accomplished.

          TURN YOUR ClOCK
          FORWARD 1 HOUR;
          THEN FORGET IT
          If you do so understand the daylight-saving-
          law, and there are many
          who are puzzled, do .not worry. Just
          before going- to bed tonight advance
          your clock one hour that Is. make
          It an hour fast and then forget It
          Go about 'your business as usual.
          You will notice no difference or
          change, except that, the sun will rise
          later and will set later. The even
          ings will be an hour longer.
          Under the Jaw. all of the clocks of
          the nation must be. advanced one 'hour
          at 2 o'clock' tomorrow morning-.
          There, is. no need' of staying, up until
          2 o'clock, however: you can turn the
          clock up Just aa well before, going to
          bed.
          Here's a lip.
          If perchance you are prone to stay
          out late Saturday night be sure and
          tell wlfey the time' when you come
          in. before the clocks are turned up,
          otherwise you will be an hour worse
          off. 'for official time will akip from
          2 to 3 o'clock in an Instant tomorrow
          morning-.
          If -you fail- to advance jrour docks
          and, watches on hour before, going to
          bed tonight .you will be an hour be
          hind .the country and everybody else
          tomorrow. Tou will get to Sunday
          school or church an hour late, and
          your meals will be off schedule. If
          you do not realise this Sunday, you
          will be on hour late getting- to work
          Monday morning.
          Those who have to work on Satur-
          Tbere is no occasion for the slightest confusion in
          the matter of daylight saving, which begin tomorrow.
          All you have to do is when you go to bed tonight, set
          your clock oxK hour ahead. Get up at the regular time,
          BY THE CLOCK, and proceed as usuaL The simplest
          statement of the whole thing is set the clock arc hour
          ahead and follow the clock.

          GIVES YOU MORE TIME
          If You Play Golf Just Think of the
          Extra Daylight You'll Have to
          Chase Over the
          Green.
          Complete plans for the daylight sav
          ing system, which' goes into effect to
          morrow have been announced by fed
          eral officials and the nation's workers
          are ready to push the hands of the
          •clock one hour ahead to assist Uncle
          Sam In hig fight for liberty.
          Every city in the country, every
          town and village, everything is in
          readiness for the new system, a sys
          tem that will save the nation thou
          sands of tons of coal daily as well as
          assisting the working man, the shop
          girl and the laboring clasa as well as
          the busy office man.
          What this plan means to the nation
          can be described in a few words. In
          the first place It means the conserva
          tion of the fuel supply. Secondly,-it
          gives the average man more time to
          devote to gardening, which In turn
          means a "bigger supply of food for the
          nation and, thirdly, it means a more
          healthy nation.
          The work of the masses will be done
          In daylight, where, heretofore, it was
          done In the dark a certain number of
          hours a day.
          Favored by All.
          Since the plan was first spoken of
          it has attracted the attention of some
          of the biggest men in the country.
          Efficiency experts have studied the
          plans and in very instance have re
          turned a favorable report on their
          study.
          The action has been favored by
          President Wilson for the past several
          months. Garfield and Hoover have
          been ardent supporters of the plan.
          There has never been an argument
          against the system and every learned
          man in the country is of the J.rsllef that
          the plan will greatly aid the nation's
          savings.
          The daylight saving plan will give
          the following daily advantages:
          One hour or more for outdoor rec
          reation. Recreation is a national as
          set, an immense force for health and
          moral well-being.
          Working mothers and fathers obtain
          an extra hour for outdoor play with
          their children, both summer and win
          ter.
          One hour less for bad lights in tene
          ments.
          Lessened eyestrain for workers and
          school children due to the use of artifi
          cial light.
          Smaller risk of accident in indus
          trial establishments, because there
          jwill he a light hour instead of a dark
          one at the end of the working day at
          ,tlie time of greatest fati-gue and most
          {frequent accidents.
          Lessened risk of accidents due to
          I transportation and traffic conditions,
          because the afternoon rush will fall in
          iduylight Instead of darkness,
          Working girls will be on the way
          home in the daylight instead of in the
          !dark in winter.
          Our last hour of sleep will be sound
          ier and more 'beneficial than it is un
          der present conditions, because there
          will be less light.
          General efficiency will, of course, be
          •increased by any improvement in the
          (health morals and social welfare of
          tiie workers and others.
          Morning Coolness.
          I In summer a cool hour In the morn
          jing is substituted for a hot one In
          I the afternoon.
          I In winter a light hour at the end of
          the day is substituted for a dark one.
          This is especially valuable com^g as
          it does at the time of greatest fatigue,
          and is peculiarly valuable in some in
          dustries where aocurate eyesight is
          essential.
          Efficiency is lowest in the later aft
          ernoon, the time when- accidents are
          roost frequent.
          There will be the greatest of all sav
          ings—that of hnman materials, as
          pointed out above.
          Immediate saving in form of reduc

          ing of those who like to work in their
          gardens, utilizing the extra outdoor
          hour for this purpose.
          A memorandum containing the fol
          lowing important reasons tor the uni
          versal adoption of the daylight saving
          plan, looking at the matter from the
          standpoint of war needs, was sent to
          the house committee in February:
          The training of the national forces
          will be expedited, and the practice of
          home guards and similar organiza
          tions, the members of which have oth
          er regular occupations, will be great
          ly facilitated.

          DETROIT TO IGNOKE CHANGE.
          Central Standard Time to Be Official
          Effectire Tonight.
          DETROIT. Mich., March 30.?Time
          pieces of Detroit will not be changed
          when the daylight saving: law '^becomes
          effective. Eastern standard time has
          been operative here for nearjy three
          years, and to avoid advancing the
          clocks another hour the city council
          has adopted an ordinance making cen
          tral standard the official time for De
          troit when the national law takes ef
          fect.
          CLOCK TIME GAINS AN HOUR
          WHILE HOUSEHOLDERS SLEEP
          Morning Slumber Is Curtailed, But Time
          Given in Evening for War Work,
          Under Daylight-Saving Law.
          What arc you going to do with the
          first hour of daylight you saved-this
          morning? And what became of the
          hour of deep you lost last night?prob
          ably without "knowing it?
          While you were sleeping the clocks
          all over the city and all over the coun
          try were Bet ahead one hour, in con-'
          formlty with the daylight-saving law
          recently passed by Congress. The hour
          of slumber lost this morning, however,
          will be returned to you next fall, when,
          under the provisions ot the new law, the
          clocks are set back one hour in the
          early morning hours of October 31.
          Emulating a plan that has proved
          successful in Great Britain and con
          tinental Europe, the government de
          cided to adopt daylight saving as a
          war conservation measure. One lost
          hour last night has gained millions of
          daylight hours that will be of inesti'
          mable value in speeding up the Wsir.'
          Expedites Training of Troops.
          Training of troops will .be expedited.
          Men working in war plants all this
          summer will complete an hour's work
          before the sun gets high in the sky,
          and will finish their day's work in tim?*
          to have more daylight for recreation or
          home gardening. It is expected that
          risk of accident in industrial establish
          ments will be reduced considerably be
          cause there will be one more light hour
          instead of a dim one at the end of the
          day. Traffic a*fd transportation will be
          helped because the late day crush will
          come in full daylight instead of gather
          ing twilight.
          A general improvement in health and
          social welfare of workers is forecast.
          Also, it is claimed the last hour of
          sleep will be sounder and more bene
          ficial because the sleeper will not be
          exposed to the glare of morning sun
          light.
          Proponents of the daylight-saving
          plan believe the extra hour well riiay
          be devoted to home gardening, thus
          relieving the national food shortage.
          Prof. T. M. Carver of Harvard told
          Congress' committee that "an hour's
          work a day in a garden will produce an
          amasing amount of food."
          "Unless something unforeseen hap
          pens," he said.t "the world, la going to
          experience the greatest food shortage
          in the next year that it has known
          since the Napoleonic wars. The
          chances are that there will be many
          huttgry people In our cities, not be
          cause there .is not enough work for
          them to do, not .because money. wages
          will not be high, but because food
          will be hard to get at any price. Any
          thing which wilt enable workingmen
          to produce a part of their own food
          is, therefore,-of uthiost importance."
          One of the most direct benefits from
          daylight saving will be. the great con-
          servation of illuminants. It is im
          possible to compute, with any degree
          of accuracy, the amount of electricity,
          gas and oil to be conserved. The
          a:mount saved by gas and electric
          illuminating plants will serve mate
          rially to help avert a recurrence of
          last winter's coal shortage.
          Saving in Foreign Countries.
          Foreign countries which put the plan
          into effect found that not only great
          amounts of coal, wejre. saved, but that
          the practice of rising early gave con
          siderable stimulus to workers in the
          war industries. England, France and
          Germany are well satisfied with the
          experiment.
          It was pointed out while the daylight
          saving bill was being debated in Con
          gress that the plan would cause abso
          lutely no disorganization or dislocation
          of normal living conditions. So far as
          actual operation is concerned, it may be
          forgotten until the day comes in Octo
          ber to revert the clocks to "sun" time.
          The householder who has been in the
          habit of rising at 8 o'clock will get up
          at his usu*l "clock" time, will transact
          his daily business on his usual schedule,
          and will retire at his usual "clock"
          hour. However, in all these movements
          he will be an hour ahead of the sun.
          The four time sones of the country?
          eastern, centra], mountain and Pacific
          are retained, but the clocks set an hour
          ahead of standard sun time. It was
          thought that some confusion might
          have attended the time changes on1 the
          railroads, because of the thousands of
          trains in operation when the clocks
          were moved forward last night. How
          ever, arrangements were made to avoid
          interruption or risk of accident.
          When that extra hour was "absorbed"
          early this morning hundreds of night
          workers throughout the city "lost out."
          This was the way it happened:
          Employes of the city post office, for In
          stance, working through last night to
          thla morning, performed full service of
          eight hours and a half hour for lunch.
          Irrespective of the chance In clock time.
          Those who reported at midnight had to
          work until 9:30 o'clock this morning. In
          stead of 8:3t), In order to be credited with
          eight hours of actual service during
          their tour of duty, the odd hour being
          absorbed by the advancement in time
          from 2 to 3 o'clock.
          CLEVELAND HUE UNCHANGED.
          Awaits Action of Beaolntion in Conn
          cil to Die Central Standard.
          CLEVELAND, Ohio, March 80.?While
          practically every city In the country
          will turn its clocks forward one hour
          at 2 o'clock tomorrow morning. Cleve
          land's clocks -will remain unchanged,
          temporarily at least.
          A resolution Introduced In the city
          council on March 18 would put this city,
          now on eastern time, on a central time
          basis, but an amendment one week
          later provides that clocks be moved
          forward one hour. It is expected the
          council will decide the problem at Its
          meeting next Monday night.

          Daylight Saving.
          From the Shreveport Caucasian.]
          The daylight saving plan as provided
          by Congress and appro veil by Presi
          dent Wilson will become effective ou
          Sunday next, the 31st. Tlie plan will
          go into effect and lie observed without
          the slightest disorganization or impair
          ment of existing conditions. Trains
          will lie run as usual, and every feature
          orally life into which tlie element of
          time enters will reinuin unchanged.
          Before retiring on the last Saturday
          of this month the American house
          holder will set his clock one lionr
          ahead, aud then may go to sleep and
          forget entirely aliout daylight saving
          until the last Saturduy in October. On
          that night he will reverse the process,
          turning hack the hands of the clock an
          hour, and the next day the nation will
          again, run on "sun" time.
          The success of the" plan has beeir
          practicafly and effectively demonstrat
          ed in twelve Europeun countries. This
          daylight saving will he continued until
          the last Sunday in October.

          letters are put a small distance apart At

          It is three or four inches high and very thin
          and light Two persons tit opposite each
          other and take the board upon their knees at
          in the picture. The little four-legged table ia
          placed upon the board. The two persons
          grasp tightly with the thumb and forefinger
          the comers of the table that are next to them.

          The two sit down and become quiet, asking
          rtioml" After a few minutes the little table
          begins to move over the board, It is an In
          tel lig nt, or at least, a semi-intelligent force
          that guides the table, for it answers
          questions. Bomettmes It talks utter nonsense
          and again it will write real information.
          The table spells out sentences in this way.
          When a question is asked, the table moves
          towards the tetters, and the foot stops upon
          the first one of the sentence to be written out
          Then it passes to the next one and the next
          and so on, with more or less rapidity, a
          gentleman, who hat experimented with the
          thing, says: "Sometime the table will cover
          two letters with Its feet and then yon hang

          One man who tnougnt nit lamiiy was
          spending too much time over the talking ma

          Journey. When the talking board could not
          be found some one made anotner, ana tne
          amusement went on. as before. To tho qu
          tion what had become of the other board the
          answer was given, "Jack burned It up,
          which somewhat astonished Jack on his re
          turn.
          The questions may be asked mentally, even
          by persons sitting in the room several feet
          away from the operators, and tha answers
          are given Just as readily. Ia some cases re
          markable and truthful revelations are said to
          have been given about living persons. But it
          it not well to girt too much heed to these
          revelations.

          Nineteenth Century
          This most interesting and
          mysterious talking board has
          awakened great curiosity wher
          ever shown.
          It surpasses in its results
          second sight, mind reading, or
          clairvoyance.
          It consists of a small table
          placed upon a large board con
          taining the alphabet and nume
          rals. By simply resting the
          fingers of two persons upon
          the small table it moves, and
          to all intents and purposes be
          comes a living, sensible thing,
          giving intelligent answer to
          any questions that can be pro
          pounded. Wonderful as this may seem
          the "OUIJA" was thoroughly
          tested at the United States
          Patent Office before the patent
          was allowed.

          v In New York, Boston, Chicago, St.
          Louis and various parts of the coun
          try. Perhaps tho most remarkable le-
          Iccnt experiences with it arc those of
          Mrs, John Curran of St, Louis. Sho
          has been in communication, she says,
          with the spirit of Patience Worth, a
          woman beliovcd to have existed in
          lhe Colonial days and who not only
          has sent philosophical axioms that
          are characteristic of tho Puritans
          but even has gone to tho extent of
          sending outlines of plays and es
          says and has gone extensively Into
          the dictation of poetry. More than
          300,000 words havo been received
          from this supposed spirit in ihieo
          years.
          Long condemned by religious as
          the direct agency of satan and by
          i skeptics as the toy of the supcrsti-
          tlous, the ouija board is being ro
          f stored to its own former popularity
          I through the curiosity of society wo
          men. In many parts of the country oo
          clety women are devoting their timo
          to "communicating" with spirits in
          tho other world.
          Many sti'ango results of such com
          munications are reported and a ao
          t clety woman is unhappy indeed if

          lit! cIety women arc supposed to bo
          1$ very conservative, tho ouija board
          il has been, restored to favor whilo
          HA
          in New York and In various
          cities of the east it is quite the
          "rage."
          In St Louis Mrs. John H. Curran
          has gotten into touch with one Pa
          tience Worth of Spiritland and has
          transcribed more than 300,000 words
          thiough the ouija board, all of which
          will be published at some future
          date.
          Patience Worth is believed from
          her peculiar choice of words and
          phraseology to be a Colonial dame,
          who has been wandering about In
          space for a long time, burning to
          send her messages back to the mun
          dane sphere yet finding no source of
          communication until Mrs. Curran
          bought a ouija board and com
          menced taking messages.
          THROUGH
          CURIOSITY.
          The board Avas purchased through
          curiosity. There is something fas
          cinating about the tales told of tho
          little board, whether they be- true
          or false. It is known that a num
          ber of people have asked the board
          to tell them in what land their dead
          iclativcs liugercd and were shocked
          considerable- when the naughty Utile
          hoard spelled out a word starling
          A ith an H and ending with an L.
          Many have thought that the words
          written bv the board were the result
          of the mental influences oC the per
          son opeiating it. while others have
          credited it with supernatural pow
          ers.
          HOW IT
          BEGAN.
          Mrs. Curran told her audience of
          her first experiences with tho ouija
          WW
          w
          board and of the puzzling messages
          received. Later sho used the'board
          together with Mrs Emily Grant
          Hutchings and began to receive
          sentences which foimcd maxims and
          philosophical paragrapbs.
          The ouija board has been con- JH
          demned by various religious bodies, iH
          but society is taking it up beside il
          these prohibitions. The Catholic tl
          church has condemned it as a super-
          stitlous practice. H
          Other religious bodies havo u- H
          clarcd that the devil is in hc boaid H
          and employs it to send his messages. H
          Whatever the truth may be, so-
          ciety has gone into the mystery of lH
          tho board, not so much with the ob- iH
          jeet of definitely deciding if it really jH
          is the medium of communication H
          with the other world but to,gratlfy H
          society's chief attribute Curiosity. H

          oulja board, which some years ago ex-
          cited the country and then virtually
          disappeared, has again come Into the
          Umellgbt throughout the world, two
          brothers are engaged In litigation here
          over the ownership of the patent, t

          originated, manufactured and placed
          upon the market the board under the
          copyright name of the oracle 'and
          that later William Fuld started the
          manufacture of ihe oulja board.
          William Fuld asserts that he and
          Isaac Fuld were In business together
          years ago, and that the oulja board
          Is the original talking board, and
          claims that tlie oracle talking board
          manufactured by Isaac Fuld Is a
          copy of the one placed on the market
          by him.

          In charge of a wooden toy factory
          known as the Kennard Manufacturing
          company, and the oulja board was one
          of the devicesthey made to entertain

          SIX years ago Mrs. John H Curran, of St. Louis, a
          peculiarly healthy-minded, normal young woman,
          who is the wife of the former Immigration Commis
          sioner of Misitvouri, began for amusement to experiment
          with the ouija board. This peculiar instrument for receiv
          ing meaaages foom the beyond" consists of a flat wooden
          board, about two feet long by one and a half wide, on
          which are th? letters of the alphabet, the numerala up to
          ten and the words ''Yea," "Mo," "Don't know" and
          "Good-by." A little heart-shaped table on three legs is
          placed on top of the board. The sitters place the board
          upon their knees, the finger tips of both hands lightly upon
          the heart-shaped table. After a while an "influence,"
          "apirit" or "spook" begins to move the heart-shaped
          board, whose narrow end then points to the letters, spell
          ing out the words of ?ta* message. A third person, an
          observer, acts as amenuensis, taking down the letters as
          the pointer indicates them.
          The "mestages" are accounted for by non-spiritualista
          as an expression of the sub-conscious self of one or both
          of the sitters; the mysterious movement of the table is
          supposed to be due to unconscious muscle rhythms of the
          hands of the sitters.

          board and its uncanny revelations
          form the basis of a $10,000 suit here
          against Albert Yost. Recently Yost's
          home was burglarized. An Ouija
          board was consulted to solve the mys
          tery surrounding the robbery. Answ
          ering the question "Who robbed my
          house?" the board is said to have
          replied "Frank Walter." Walter is
          Yost's neighbor. They have (been
          lifelong friends. The board is also
          said to have implicated Mrs. Walter.
          The board's accusations became
          known to Mrs. Walter, who called at
          the Yost home. She was told the
          Yosts had nothing to retract and
          forthwith filed suit for $10,000
          against Yosts, alleged slander. The
          Yosts deny the charge and insist they
          have uttered no word which might be
          interpreted as defaming the charac
          ter of the Walters.

          Ouija Board Invades Britain
          LONDON, Nov. 10.
          THE ouija board has invaded
          Britain! It masquerades un?
          der the pseudonym of "plan?
          chette," but it is the familiar
          alphabet and flatiron device that has
          helped to while away the tedium of
          prohibition in the United States.
          And apparently it has landed in
          force, because even now officials of
          women's clubs are debating as to
          whether the planchette is a game,
          or, if it isn't, what it is.
          "If it is a game." argued one club
          secretary, "it should be played as a
          game In the cardroom and during
          the regulation card hours. As it is,
          the planchette enthusiasts are busily
          occupied with their favorite pastime
          from early morn to dewy eve."
          Although she waxed poetic at the
          end, it was evident that the official
          was really disturbed about the exact
          status of the planchette. F->r it is
          said that the fascinating business of
          receiving messages from the spin*
          world?not the s?ance which was w
          popular following the war, but the
          more informal question-and-answer
          of the ouija board?is quite ousting
          the card games.
          If no regulation planchette is at
          hand a substitute, consisting of ?B
          ordinary inverted tumbler surround?
          ed by cardboard letters, is CtB*

          and it skips lightly from one letf*r
          to another spelling out its message*.
          And the planchette is less ex?
          pensive than bridge, because no on*
          yet has thought of betting on tM
          spirits! -?j

          Whether there is truth in a statmmnt that the ouija
          board is adding patients to Wasinta asums
          through disturbing infinenoes augon District mentalitin,
          students of mental phenomena will be inteAsted in the
          fact that the board takes its name from the French
          word oui (yes) and the German word ja (yes). Its
          origin is somewhat obscure. Both the planohette and
          ouija, somewhat simila in appearanes, date back to
          about 1855, and for a while were objects of consider
          able superstition. The planchette is a small board
          fitted with a pencil and two casters, made to move
          easily over a sheet of paper when the hands rest lightly
          on it. The dictionary says the ouija "is a form of
          planchatte used in spiritualistic seaness or the like.
          It consists of two parts, a board containing the al
          phabet and other characters, and a planehette, with
          a pointer substituted for the pencil."
          Investigation of automatic writings fail to find that
          the two boards have any origin in the mysticisms of
          Egypt. One writer is of the opinion that the iret at
          tempt in ouijaing was made by a man on his wife's
          breadboard. The skeptical refer to the board as
          wholly a modem trick afair which has no connection
          with Eastern or other metaphysics.
          Some of the noted spiritualists of the world make use
          of the ouija or planchette and carefully study the
          results. An able group of psychologists regard the
          ouija as a dangerous deception. Their theory is that
          the subconscious mind of the operator directs the
          fingers in such a way as to convey the information
          hoped for. The operator, they hold, is as innocent of
          this subconscious process as a sleep-walker is of what,
          he is doing, and naturally puts a supernatural con
          struction on the outcome.
          Leading spiritualists and other believers in higher
          agencies than natural ones, confident that communica
          tion with the other world is not only established but
          is developing into an understanding that will glorify
          humanity, are willing to accept the ouija board or any
          other method of transmission that will add ti the in
          formation they feel they now possess. Those of ma
          terial minds, who deride all supernatural beliefs and
          theories, hold to the opinion that after every great
          war there is a wave of the occult in some form, and
          say that right now the ouija board happens to be the g
          most popular man-made medium of bringing together
          terrestrial pinds and celestial beings and thoughts.

          Ouija Boards Are
          Sporting Goods,
          Rules Court
          WASHINGTON, June 5. The
          supreme court today announced it
          would not determine what fs a oui
          ja board.
          The question was presented in a
          case brought by the Baltimore Talk
          ing Board Company, which protest
          td against taxation of such boards
          as sporting goods, and insisted that
          should the court refuse to hold that
          the board "is a grade of motor an
          toism, involving considerable sub
          conscious action of intelligence,"
          that it should at least classify the
          smaller boards as "children's toys"
          The lower federal counts sustain
          ed the government's contention
          that the boards should be classed
          as sporting goods.

          A Great National Park.
          Hon. N. P. Langford, of Slontann, the
          leader of the famous Yellowstone expedi
          tion of last year, is now in Washington,
          and, in eonneetion with Professor Hayden,
          who had charge of the government expedi
          tion of this year, is engaged in promoting
          the project of declaring all that district, in
          cluding the canon of the Yellowstone, the
          hot springs and the geysers a government
          reservation, for the purpose of holding it
          forever as a national park. • Copies of the
          May and June numbers ot Scribner's Month
          ly. containing Langford's graphic story of
          "Tnc Wonders ol the Yellowstone," have
          been furnished to every member of Con
          gress. Professor Hayden lias prepared an
          article f«r the February number of Scrib
          ner's. in which he confirms Langford's ac
          count. describes additional marvels discov
          d by himself, aud takes strong ground
          in favor of the park project. Such a park
          will, in time, attract to it crowds of the
          pleasure seekers and scientists of Europe
          It is not only remarkable for its scenery,
          but in a scientific point of view is said to
          be "the most marvelous region on the face
          of the earth." The illustrations, which are
          to appear in the February number of Scrib
          tier, are lroin photographs taken by the re
          cent expedition.

          Devoted to the Curioui and
          Scautlful Sccnee la tlia No
          tlonal Reservation.
          Written for Tire Trllntne.
          Here boglns another chnpter of our
          Story. Having crnssed the continent
          over the main line of the Northern J'n
          elllo railway and witnessed. Its Rrnmli'tir
          vt scenery and Hiirnrlws for twenty
          ftBht suifesHlve days, we will retrace
          our HtepH tor two thousand inlloa to
          LlvliiRston and Rather up Home of the
          wonderful scenery we lost In linssin";.
          We will re-enter for that purpose the
          portal of the Yellowstone National
          Park, "Tho Wonderland of North
          America."
          When this Indian reservation was
          set aside to be forever the Brand tourist
          reHort of the people and their common
          property by the peneral Kovernnient,
          few had any Idea of the endless variety
          and stupendous grandeur of the fea
          tures embraced In tills tract of country
          Klxty-five by seventy-five miles In ex
          tent. This volcanic, region Is located
          about midway in our national domain.
          It nestles in the heart of the Kooky
          mountains covering un nrea of :i.57;i
          mpiure miles and Is encircled by ning
          liillcent snow peaks from ten to nearly
          fourteen thousand feet high. No valley
          within its limits has an elevation less
          than G.000 feet above sea level, while the
          averaK Is about H.UuO feet. This freak
          of nature is only a little spot of earth
          in the northwest coiner of Wyoming,
          coverliiff a few miles of Montana on the
          north and overlapping into Idaho and
          Montana on the west. It is one
          of thu preatPst water-sheds on the
          earth. Three of the larRest rivers in
          the United States have their source in
          Yellowstone park tho Missouri, the
          Yellowstone, the Snake. These Htrenins
          born within HlRlit of each other, lose
          themselves in three mighty rivers that
          seek old ocean thousands of miles apart
          from each other. Here, too, is the lar
          Reat body of water in North America
          lit this altitude of nearly 8,000 feet.
          Within this wonderful domain are fifty
          peysers which uro said to outclass
          MAMMOTH HOT
          nnythlnjj In the known w orld, throwing
          legulurly a column of hot water from
          thirty to two hundred and lifty feet
          in the air between intervals of from
          one minute to fourteen days, besides,
          within the boundaries of this wonder
          ous geyser land there are known to be
          una hundred geysers and 3.600 springs
          and pools, together with paint pots,
          mud springs, lukes canyons, rivers and
          small parks, ad infinitum. Here in the
          "Grund Canyon of the Yellowstone,"
          ten miles long with, an average depth
          of a quarter of a mile which 1 ac
          knowledged to be the most brilliantly
          colored landscape in existence, and
          "Mammoth Hot Springs," the only col
          ored terrace-building hot springs know n
          that liuve such beauty and magnitude;
          also cliffs of volcanic glass, mountains
          of petrefactlon, hills or brimstone, un
          surpassed waterfalls, interspersed with
          thousands of natural curiosities, sur
          rounded by perpetual snow clad peaks
          which rise Into cloudland. all of which
          fittingly characterize this as the won
          derland of America and of the world.
          ' ITS HISTORY AND DISCOVERY.
          This weird and enchanted spot Is only
          M recent .discovery. Often did the
          thought occur to us as w traversed it,
          , why was it so long undiscovered. It
          was not until 1870 that this remarkable
          locality became known, although as far
          bark as 1S06 some Inkling of what was
          to be found there was Riven bv the
          Lewis and Clark exploring expedition.
          The stories then told came largely
          from frontier guides and mountaineers
          and were disbelieved, and more than
          Ixty years elapsed before the residents
          of Montana attempted to explore it,
          althought several expeditions sent out
          by the government had crossed the con
          tinent In search of the most suitable
          route for the Pacific railway; in fact.
          the whole western domain was crossed
          and re-crossed by these exploring
          parties, and still the Yellowstone Park
          country remained undiscovered. It was
          left to John Colter (the first white ex
          plorer) to know and tell of its wonders,
          and then to General Washburn, in 1870,
          to enter the Inner wilds of this myster
          ious land, escorted by Lieutenant
          Doaae, of the United States army, and
          in 1871-72 for Professor P. T. Hayden,
          United States geologist, to make a
          thorough discovery under the sanction
          of congress and largely through his ln-

          fluence and efforts it became a national
          reservation. It peonis strange that a
          region so remarkable as this, was so
          long an unknown land to us. That,
          this is so. Is undoubtedly mvlng to the
          fact that from the east and south the
          Park Is almost impossible of approach
          on account of the character of the
          mountains. Tho region is more than
          lifty miles south of the nearest route
          traveled by explorers, besides hostile
          Indians were in this Immediate vicinity
          in very early days. Hut the question
          is aptly unsweivtl by Mr. O. 1). Wheel

          preserve it In nil tts Integrity, its nat
          ural grandeur and beauty forever. Just
          us nature made it." Since the Park
          was reserved for Its present purpose,
          congress has set aside as a "timber re
          serve" nnother tract on the south and
          east of about two thousand Bqunre
          miles, making the- entire reservation
          one-fourth larger than my native state,
          Connecticut. This ni t prevents the tim
          ber here from being cut down or want
          only burdened under severe penalties.
          SPRINGS HOTEL.
          The completion of the Northern rarlfic
          railway across the continent was an
          important event for the Park, espe
          cially so when their branch line of
          fifty-one miles brought them to Cinna
          bar at its northern boundary. Thin
          road brings the tourist from his far
          away home and sets him down amidst
          the mountains and confines of this
          wonderland. "Thus far und no far
          ther," said Mr. Wheeler to t ie, "i
          Uncle Sam's edict to railroads, and
          none may venture beyond the imagin
          ary boundary line."
          Connected with the Park are four
          Important factors, each Independent of
          the other, yet co-ordinate branches.
          These are the United States govern
          ment, the Northern Pacific railway, the
          V - eV- '"TZ- AT'W
          Yellowstone Pork association, and tho
          Yellowstone National Park Transpor
          tation compuny. Like four separate,
          yet integral parts of the samo machine,
          thry work sympathetically and ,Jhar
          ninnioutdy toward tho same end. The
          avenue of annrouvh. to the Park Is one
          entirely in keeping with its character.
          Having given our readers a condensed
          outline of this mysterious land of won
          ders, we will invite them to follow us
          in our dally travels through It. We
          leave the main line of the road and
          start in to see the park at Livingston,
          for it's only through Livingston on the
          Northern Pacific road, that we can
          reach it. Livingston as described In a
          former letter, lies at the base of the
          Know and Helt ranges spurs of the
          Kocky mountains.
          Some people, like ourselves, have an
          idea, that we enter the Park on the
          same elevation above the sea, ami in
          the same manner as itv would enter
          Kaliniount Park, of Philadelphia, or
          Central Park, New York. This Is a
          mistaken idea we commence at Llv
          iiiKslon on elevation above sea level
          hi 4.4 .0 feet, urn! ascend to Cinnabar,
          filfy-uiie miles, on a grade of eighty
          feel to the mile overcoming 700 feet.
          We do not leave our drawing-mom
          car until Ciimaliar is reached. The
          ride through this Interesting valley,
          hounded by mountains, is mi appro
          priate prelude to what follows in the
          park Itself. It Is called a park. Your
          minds shuliM be disabused of a mis
          conception. It has nothing such as an
          ordinary park would Indicate. No
          gravelled walks no velvety lawns, no
          statuary, no (lower beds, etc., but all
          this extensive area Is literally crowded
          with natural curiosities of the most
          wonderful character. The hotels and
          the government roads and bridges are
          the only artificial things to be found
          here, everything else being In Its nat
          ural condition, rude, stein and wild.
          Three miles from Livingston, . the
          railroad passes through the first "can
          yon of the Yellowstone," which forms
          a natural entrance Into the I'pper Yel
          lowstone valley. This canyon Is about
          u mile long and Just wide enough to
          comfortably admit the read und river,
          the mountain walls rising 2,000 feet
          perpendicularly on either side. Pass
          ing through this first canyon we enter
          Paradise valley, which Is from seven
          to twelve miles wide and extends some
          thirty miles along the Yellowstone river
          which tumbles anil pounds continuous
          ly, clear as crystal and cold as Ice.
          This valley lias been settled by ranch
          men. The land Is very fertile nnd Irri
          gation has been carried on to a high
          state of perfection, making the valley
          as productive as the corn belt of Illi
          nois, The rich ranches strolohliig-be-
          f

          like great Persian rugs with their har
          monious blending of colors, put this is
          not the district In which one wishes to
          specify and particularize. As the train
          moves southward, the mountain scen
          ery is ever changing and picturesque.
          The most prominent peak Is Emigrant,
          In the south end of the valley, which
          rises proudly a mile anil a quarter
          above tho valley to an elevation
          of Hi.fi29 feet. Forty miles fronr Liv
          ingston we puss through the "second
          canyon of the Yellowstone," called
          "Y'linkee Jim Canyon," named for an
          enterprising Yankee, who, prior to
          bulldliifr the railroad, built a wagon
          road through the canyon at great ex
          pense and enjoyed a lucrative business
          In collecting toll from each visitor to
          the park. Yankee Jim Is still located
          here and has many piscatorial guests
          during the tourist season, who tind the
          best of trout fishing In these swift wat-
          rs. This canyon Is far more pictur
          esque than the first, as the mountain
          walls rise higher, und Hie gorge within
          which the river Is compressed. is scarce
          ly loo feet wide. This valley Is the bed
          f an ancient lake, with glaciated boul

          dish band of arenaceous clay about 100
          feet wide, called Cinnabar, which gave
          the name of the mountain. "The Devil's
          Slide" Is found her, formed by two walls
          of trap-rock some l.'iO feet apart, which
          precipitates 2,tHio feet down a mountain
          Hank like a toboggan slide, and Is
          strikingly realistic to the tourists. One
          says, "It demonstrates how easy His

          tance of one hundred and sixty miles.
          Here is a line of six-horse tally-ho
          coaches awniting the tourist for a drive
          of seven miles to Mammoth Hot Springs
          hotel.

          comfortable chair car fur others equal

          seven miles to the famous hotel. Thin
          ride is the first day's pleasure drive in
          the park, and it is over an excellent
          macadamizi d road; and right here I
          wish to emphasize the superiority of
          TERRACES AT MAMMOTH SPRINGS.

          among the pleasant feutures of the
          park trip was the strong bridges, grace
          ful curves and good roads. We wind
          along the Gardiner river, which has Its
          source from the snow ravines of "Klcc
          trlo Peak," clear as crystal and cold
          as ice; this river unites with the Yel
          lowstone at Cinnabar. The grade gf
          the carriage road . is. very steep, as
          nearly ii.OOO feet hus to be overcome be
          fore reaching Mammoth Hot Springs,
          mainly in the last two miles, -when the
          road leaves the river to ascend the
          mountain. Klght ut this point 1 toiling
          or Hot river empties into the cold, pure
          waters of the Gardiner. The former Is
          the combined ovei llow of ull the waters
          of Mammoth Hot Springs, made' fa
          mous from the fact that fish may bo
          cuught In the cold stream and cooked
          in the but stream without change of
          position. After a long climb a sudden
          turn is made, and the famous Mam
          moth Hot Springs hotel is seen in tie
          distance, and presently we pass
          through a gateway of ruck and behold
          the strangest and most fascinating
          sight unlike unything , seoil else
          where, it Is a rang. of snow
          white terraces, rising like glguutie
          steps of marble forming ii.-bus.in
          filled with boiling bubbling water, heat
          ed by nuture's furnace, und sending
          forth clouds of ste;:ui. These ter
          races are the . gorgeously arrayed,
          exquisitely filigreed, nnd richly col
          ored cliffs of "Mammoth Hot
          Springs." In front of us Is a level
          plateau, where, besides the famous ho
          tel, are several other buildings, uinoug
          them Camp Sheridan, the headquarters
          of the superintendent of the park, and
          proudly floating from his oflielal resl-'
          dence, was the "stars and stripes'
          which gracefully'salutcd us In acknowl
          edgement of "three cheers for the old
          Hag," alter we set foot on our own
          nationul domuin, the wonderland of
          America. .
          This park is under the exclusive con
          trol of the secretary of the Interior,
          with Contain George S. Hunter as su
          perintendent, and two companies of
          cavalry. With United States soldiers
          for police, it Is the most law abiding
          section in our country today. There
          are no saloons, no gambling houses,
          thieves, highway robbers, or Indian
          massacres. No man, except he be n
          federal olllcer, can carry fire-arms of
          any description. These two com
          panies nntrol the park that no net of
          vandalism be committed or the marvel
          ous and delicate formations be disturbed.
          These soldiers stand guard over all this
          domuin according equal rights to ull
          and sperj 1 favors to none.
          A st a' trout story nnd we close this,
          our first day's park experience. As we
          reached the "Mulling river" on our
          stage ride from t'lnnubar, our attention
          was called to two gentlemen who were
          fishing in the Ice cold Gardiner river.
          One of them had cuught a' trout and
          without unhooking It, he swung tlie line
          nnd fish over into the boiling river, nnd
          It was said the fish was cooked and
          ready for the fable In less time thnn it
          takes me to tell the story. This is my
          first fish story. Tell me if this is not
          Wonderland.

          TRAVELLING ON SKIS.
          In Harden Valley, Yellowstone Park.
          ROOSEVELT OA 7 SKIS.
          President May Have to Use Them
          in Yellowstone Park.
          Probably no one has ever seen a President of
          faese United States Sticking head first ma
          Vowl.ank. thrown there by a tricky pair of skis.
          Most President* have kept .way from «.o«
          banks, and the thought of mixing up with sk.s
          never entered their heads.
          The soldiers who will guide and [Presi
          de Roosevelt through Yellowstone Park when
          he reaches that interesting portion of Ins com-
          Vg Western trip may witness such a phenome
          ii o n The snow in the park is from sixteen to
          eighteen feet deep in many places, and the
          President will surely have to take to sk.s if he
          frets anywhere. He is not exactly a snowshoe
          amateur, however, and the chances are very
          uoh in favor of some one else taking the
          \ aders while the Chief Kxecutive leads the van.
          From Mammoth Hot Springs to the Golden
          Gate a distance of five miles, there is a broken
          trail and the party can ride on horseback. Be
          yond that point the park, with its white cover
          ing will seem almost as primeval as it did to
          John Colter or "Jim" Badger, the first white
          men to enter that wonderland of nature. April
          is one of the eight or nine months in which the
          park Is snowed in and the ordinary tourist
          snowed out. In May th- stage roads thaw out,
          and for three months there are visitors every
          where.
          Winter used to be the time of game harvest
          for Wyoming hunters until the government de
          cided to protect the game by keeping a com
          pany of soldiers on the reservation the year
          round. It still is the hunting season for the
          lawless "bad men" who have taken refuge in
          the Jackson's Hole Country, which is on the
          edge of the park.

          An Aspect of Nature's Wonderland
          That Few Ever See
          4
          HE polar regions are hardly
          less accessible than the Yel
          lowtone National park
          the greatest playground ol
          the American people U in
          winter. This Is scarcely
          conceivable, for In summer
          40,000 visitors now find It
          one of the easiest placea to
          Teach and to travel through.
          Lieut. Frederick Schwatka made an
          attempt to explore the park in Jan
          uary nearly 25 years ago. He had re
          turned not long before from an expe
          dition in search of Sir John Frank
          lin's party that had perished in the
          arctic regions. Before that he had
          been on a 3,000-mlle sledge journey In
          the frozen north and had suffered ter
          rible hardships. On his trip into the
          Yellowstone Park Lieutenant Schwat
          ka was accompanied by a large, well
          organized party. They "traveled" on
          Norwegian jkls and Canadian web
          ' enowBhoes; but the" Snow"" as so light
          that it would not support them, and
          their toboggans were exceedingly dif
          ficult to draw. It took them three
          days to cover 20 miles. Lieutenant
          Schwatka, inured as he was to such
          hardships, fell ill and was unable to
          proceed. He and all the rest of the
          party but four of the sturdiest men
          turned back. The photographer. F.
          J. Haynes; Edward Wilson, a govern
          ment scout, and two others kept on.
          .It took them 29 days to make the cir
          cuit of the park, 200 miles. The ther
          mometer ranged between 40 and 50
          degrees below zero most of the time,
          and the adventure nearly cost them
          their lives.
          Winter Population of the Playground.
          The total winter population of the
          park is usually between four and five
          hundred people. These Include three
          troops of cavalry. The cavalry can
          use their horses only during the sum
          mer months. During the winter they
          are stabled at Fort Yellowstone. The
          stage horses are driven down to the
          lowlands, miles away, when the tour
          ist season is over, and graze In the
          sheltered valleys there until the
          nows melt
          In the great hotels that are
          thronged during the tourist season
          live only the caretakers, generally
          two in each place. a man and his
          wife. The first blizzard Isolates from
          the world outside everybody in this
          great national domain that has an
          area of 3,312 square miles. No valley
          within its limit has an elevation of
          less than 6.000 feet, while many of
          the mountain peaks within and near'
          the park rise from 10,000 to 14,000
          feet above sea level. Yellowstone lake
          IB by 20 miles in slzo, Is the largest
          body of water In America at that alti
          tude, 7,741 feet above the sea. On

          outlets, on Into the Atlantic through
          the Yellowstone and Missouri rivers

          Snake river, a branch of the Colum
          bia, The Grand canyon of the Yel
          lowstone, ten miles long, has an aver
          ago depth of 1,200 feet, and is the
          most brilliantly colored landscape In
          existence. But In winter everything
          Is blanketed with Bnow eight to ten
          feet deep. All is Ice-bound except the
          more than half a hundred great gey
          sers that throw their columns of boil
          ing water hundreds of feet In the air,
          almost as little seen by humankind as'
          when they began their epoutlngs ages
          ago.
          From December to March the en
          forced dwellers In the park are near
          ly as much cut off from the world as

          though they were penned In by the
          polar ice. Of course the telephone
          and the telegraph bring them scraps
          of news from the outer world, but the
          only way of getting about is on
          snowshoes or skis. Even then the
          distances between the places where
          the people live are so great and the
          ways so dangerous that few venture
          forth. Only the government scouts,
          whose duty It is to look after the
          wild life In the park aftd see that It
          is not molested by poachers, get out
          at all. The rest of the people there
          are like the bearsthey hibernate
          until spring. An ample supply of fuel
          and provisions is laid in before the
          first snowstorms begin to sweep over
          the Continental divide, and there is
          little to do until the sun swings
          northward and the snows melt.
          In 182, when the fed
          eral government dedicated It "as a
          public park or pleasure ground for
          the benefit and enjoyment of the peo
          ple," probably not more than a thou
          sand persons a year were visiting It
          In the next twenty-three years the
          number of visitors climbed slowly to
          about 6,000 annually. In 1895, the au
          thorities began counting the persons
          who entered the park, and complete
          records have been kept ever since.
          There were 5,438 visitors in 1895.
          Ten years later the number had risen
          to 26,188. In 1904, it dropped to
          17,172. The next year it fell off near
          ly a thousand. In 1908 the total was
          18,748. Then came the most remark
          able increase in visitors that the park
          has ever known. In 1909 there were
          nearly twic as many (32,545) as the
          y'ear before This was principally
          due to the opening of a new railroad
          gateway to the park at Yellowstone,
          Mont. which made it much easier of
          access.
          Three-fourths of the park Is a dense
          forest, a primeval wilderness. Away
          from the few hotels, the roads and
          the trails the park today is what It
          was before even a Pharaoh reigned In
          Egypt It is such a paradise for the
          wild things' that roam at will there
          that they have lees to fear, even from
          each other and from the elements,
          than anywhere else in the wilderness.
          When the fury of the winter storms
          drives the tlk, deer, mountain sheep
          and antelope Into the sheltered val
          leys and canyons they have nothing
          to be afraid of except the pelting,
          driven steel-dust of ths mountain bliz
          zards. Nature is kind even to the
          birds. On the great terraces where

          flow Incessantly gather great flocks
          of wild ducks and other fowl.
          In this region, nearly 8,000 feet
          above the Bea, where tho mercury
          sinks away below zero from Hecem
          ber to March, there is far more won
          der and mystery in midwinter than
          the summer tourist ever nets a hint
          of. Civilization is miles away across j
          a wilderness of shining, snowclad
          mountains. The gale-driven snow
          dances over this waste and is piled
          into fantastic drifts. Sometimes It is
          swept with a roar through the miAin
          tain gorges faster than the swiftest
          railway train ever traveled. It covers
          to the eaves some of the big hotels.
          In summer times these places are buz
          zing with life, but In winter they are
          pictures of desolation, almost Indlstln-

          If the caretakers wish to get out they
          have to obtain exit from a window on
          one of the upper floors. Tall trees
          burled In the snow appear like bushes.
          The general aspect of the country is
          entirely changed.
          Masses of Purest White In Place of
          Brilliant Hued Rocks.
          The Incomparable wonder of the
          Grand canyon of the Yellowstone, that
          huge gash in Uie earth whose walls
          glow with every tint of Jewels and
          flowers, la a mass of purest white save
          where here and there the winds have
          swept away the snow and left the bill-llant-hued
          rocks exposed. Their reds
          and yellows and purples and crtmsons
          glow the brighter in contrast with the
          surrounding whiteness. The black fo
          liage of the pines stands out sharply.
          Where the water slides over the preci
          pice and forms the Great Falls of the
          ; Yellowstone, it roars down as white as
          carded wool. Down at the bottom of
          the gorge, where the waters are swift
          and deep, they are black. There are
          ; immense Icicles 200 feet long. An ice
          i bridge a hundred feet high Is formed
          at the base of the falls.
          The great geysers play endlessly,
          each at Its appointed period, although
          no one Is there to see them. Every sev
          enty minutes Old Faithful sends lt9
          columns of water and steam 300, 500,
          sometimes 1,000 feet Into the air and
          holds It there for three minutes. Some
          times the winds unfold from Its top
          an iridescent banner of spray; at oth-
          J er times the fountain form Is a perfect
          con". In winter Its boiling hot water
          gives off a vast cloud of drifting
          steam. At nightfall of a January
          j evening, this Immutable water clock
          of the Yellowstone becomes a specter
          of ghostly white, a sight so strange
          and startling that even those who
          neighbor with it never lose their awe
          of its maiestv. All about the tevsers

          The "Sisterhood" of the Geysers.
          There are more than fifty In this
          giant sisterhood of geysers. Not even
          in Iceland or New Zealand, or any-1
          where else where the earth Is still be- '
          ing made is there such a convent of
          their order as in the Yellowstone. No
          one has ever been able to describe
          them adequately in words any more
          than it has been possible to tell on tho
          printed page the extent of the won-
          ders in this "workshop of the Al-
          mighty." It is a place where almost
          every form of creative eccentricity In

          IHE FAME of Yellowstone Park
          m has been so Indelibly associated
          wllh Its wonderful geysers that
          few persons know that It Is the
          only spot in tho United States where
          tho public can see in largo numbers
          tho animals of the forests and wilds In
          their natural state. In reality It Is
          tho most successful wild animal pre
          serve In the world.
          Only those who personally know
          tho West appreciate tho changes that
          havo taken place. In Its animal life In
          the past forty years. Thirty years
          ago elk and antelope existed In la'rgo
          numbers in tho Rockies from Mexico
          to Canada, but these .animals were
          killed with no thought that they might
          ultimately bo extinguished. It was
          fortunate that when tho Yollowstono
          National Park was established, In
          1S72, It occurred to somo public mind.
          2d Individuals that Its 54 by C3 square?
          miles would mako a wonderful game
          preserve. As a result there are enough
          animals now In this park, to bo of
          rreat Interest and In ycara to come It
          may form an epltomo of conditions In
          tho wilderness that once existed In
          many places In tho West.
          Thousands Or Animals
          There aro six hundred antelope, a
          thousand- or more of deer, more than
          five hundred moose, four hundred buf
          faloes, two hundred mountain sheep,
          any number of black and grizzly bears,
          and more than thirty thousand elk.
          that mako Yellowstone Park their
          homo under Government protection.
          Those animal herds uro now being
          used ns nucleus herds for other parks
          national. State and city and for
          zoological gardens, when Government
          permits. In recent years many of the
          animals particularly the elk. bears and
          bison have been quietly taken captive
          and shipped away to various parts of
          the country.
          In early days buffaloes existed in
          large numbers In tho AY est and ranged
          from the Middle West to the Rockies.
          Now the only place whero thoy arc
          found In their original habitat Is the
          Yellowstone Park. The pronged horn
          antelope apd a large variety of moose
          found near Yellowstone Lako are oth
          er Interesting park animals.
          Animals Fed In Winter
          Though most persons see the ani
          mals of the Ycll6wstone In summer
          thero arc certain enthusiastic nulmal
          lovers who go to this remarkable Park
          In winter that they may sec them as
          they como to Gardiner, the entrance
          to tho Park to get tho alfalfa hay
          which the Government harvests each
          yoar for winter food for tho Park
          animals. Though In summer all kinds
          of animals roam In the higher parts
          , of tho Park, tho winters are so scvero
          that they arc glad to como down to
          get food. So nt Gardiner, one can seo
          tho graceful deer, hundreds of striped
          antelopes, dozens of big horn sheep
          and thousands of elks who ramblo
          about, feed, and do not seem timid at
          all.
          Every year tho beautiful deer are
          soen along the roadways and near tho
          hotels. During tho fall, winter and
          I spring they arc a familiar fcaturo or.
          tho parade ground at Fort Yellow
          stone and they seem loss timid than
          the elk, which aro apt to seclude them
          selves In the valleys and timber. But
          a short ride from tho hotels will
          usually bring a herd in view especial
          ly in the vicinity of Shoshomc Lake
          and Haydcn Valley.
          Fishing Paradise
          Of course, the fisherman gets his fill
          In this Park, whore tho waters have
          been "planted" annually over since
          1S91. It Is great fun to go fishing
          In tho lako or streams and catch the
          Loch Levin, rainbow or brook trout.
          There are few restrictions and if one JS

          I'urk, the oldest and blg
          • gest of our national
          parks, the first national
          park to he established In
          the world, the largest and
          finest geyser basin on
          earth and the most famous of big
          game preserves, will probably receive
          b largo addition of territory to the
          A°uth from the Sixty-sixth congress.
          A bill for this addition was Introduced
          In the lust congress, was passed by
          the house and was shelved In the sen
          Bte tn the confusion of the lust days of
          the Inst session.
          Yellowstone has n most romantic his
          tory. It was discovered In 1807 by
          lohn Colter. We bought the Louisi
          ana territory—the land between the
          Mississippi and the Rockies—of Nu
          poleon In 1802, without knowing any
          thing about this garden spot of the
          world. The Lewis and Clark expedi
          tion of 1804-8, whlèh made the round
          trip from St. Louis to the tuouth of the
          Columbia river to find out what we
          bad bought, passed within n few miles
          of the north end of the park without
          •vcn suspecting Its existence. Colter
          was one of the party and secured his
          discharge before reaching St. Louis to
          turn back and trap beaver. Colter re
          turned to St. Louis in 1810. The pub
          lic laughed nt his story and derisively
          dubbed this geyser land "Colter's
          Hell." Only one man believed him—
          his old commander, Capt. William
          Clark, who put .Ills 1807 route on the
          •fflclat mnp, of the expedition.
          In the '20s James Bridger, the fa
          mous plainsman, rediscovered "Col
          ter's Hell" and told of Its wonders.
          But Bridger was a genius in telling
          "tall yarns"—his obsidian cliff, and
          hot spring stories ure classics In the
          West to this day. "Just another of
          Jim Brldger's yarns" was the popular
          verdict. Prospectors who flocked to
          the region during various gold excite
          ments dlscnvcrjgd the Yellowstone the
          third time. But It was not until 1870
          that the country believed In "Colter's j
          Hell." Then there was popular enthu- !
          slasm and In 1872 the Yellowstone was
          aet a-dde by act of congress ns a na- !
          tlonnl park—a nubile playground for
          the people of the United Stutes for
          ever.
          Millions In Improvements.
          Paring the first 14 years of its ex
          totenee as a national park Yellowstone
          was administered by civilian superin- !
          tendent* good, bad and Indifferent, j
          Congress sometimes appropriated
          funds for the park and often did not.
          By 1880 conditions were so bad In the
          park and poachers were killing off the
          big game so fast that the management
          was turned over to the army. The |
          army record was excellent. With the
          creation of the national park service,
          two yenrs ago, exclusive control Is now
          In this new bureau of the Interior de
          partment, which Is charged with ad
          ministration of all nationnl parks.
          On the whole, congress has been fair
          ly liberal In appropriations. These to
          tal $3,980,523.84 to July 1. 1910. There
          are 278 miles of main and 25 miles of
          secondary road and nearly 400 miles
          of fairly well-marked trails. Fifteen
          ranger stations nre maintained; these
          are connected with headquarters near
          the north entrance by 270 miles of tel
          ephone.
          The park lies principally In the
          northwest corner of Wyoming, hut laps
          over a little Into Idaho and Montana.
          Us area is about 3,343 squares miles
          or 2,142,720 acres. Its altitude Is 0,
          000 to 11,000 feet. There nre four
          entrances : Gardiner on the north ;
          Cody on the east ; Moran on the south,
          and Yellowstone on the west. All ex
          cept Moran are railroad points. In
          1018 the travel by entrance wns:
          North, 7,504 ; east, 4,401 ; south. 542 ;
          west, 8,702.
          Tourist travel goes over n belt road
          which forms two large loops, resembles
          a- figure 8 and covers the scenic fea
          tures of the north two-thirds of the
          park. Three-flftlis of the tourist travel
          is by private automobile and the pro
          portion Is growing larger each yenr.
          Yellowstone Lacke Scenery.
          This, then Is the lay of the land.
          Yellowstone Is'by far the biggest of
          the 18 national parks and Is the best
          developed. Its geysers nre us unique
          ns the big trees of Sequoia, the lake
          of Crater Lnke and the canon of Grand
          Canon. Why. then should It he en
          larged by the addition of territory to
          the south approximately equal to one
          third of Its present area?
          The comprehensive answer Is: The
          Yellowstone Is too small. The natural
          question, then, Is, Why Is the Yellow
          stone too small ? There are several an
          swers, Including these three:
          Becnuse It lacks scenery.
          Because the region to the south Is a
          natural part of the park.
          Because the elk to the south are tn
          danger of extinction.
          Yellowstone does lack scenery of the
          majestic kind. Its peaks nre not lofty
          and rise from a high plateau. Its gey
          sers, hot springs, paint pots, etc., are
          freak scenery. In short, the Yellow
          stone does not hold the tourist. In the
          days of the stage coach It took the
          tourist about live days to see the Yel
          lowstone ; then he was ready to leave.
          Now the automobile has cut his stay
          in half. And he Is not likely to re
          turn. In strong contrast nre such
          parks ns Rocky Mountain and Yosemlte.
          There the average stay Is at least two
          weeks, while many thousands go regu
          larly every season, stay a month or
          more and look upon the park ns their
          summer home.
          The offlclui attendance flgures tell
          the story: Yellowstone, last four sea
          sons, 51,895; 35,849 ; 35,400 ; 21,275;
          Rocky Mountain, 31,000 ; 51,000; 117,
          188; 101,497. The 1918 decrease In
          both parks was due to war-time condi
          tions; Increase In railroad fares and
          government discouragement of pleas
          ure travel. The travel by private au
          tomobile held Its own. The hotels in
          Yellowstone were not open.
          The nationnl park service would
          change the Yellowstone conditions and
          would begin by enlarging the park.
          In addition It has extensive plans for
          making the Yellowstone attractive.
          These Include golf, tennis, improved
          fishing, model automobile camps, new
          trails and plenty of mountain climbing.
          The territory to be added contains
          approximately a thousand square miles
          end is known to big game hunters as
          the Jackson Hole country. It contains
          the sort of scenery that Yellowstone
          lacks. The Absaroka Itnnge along the
          east boundary contains several lofty
          peaks and Younts Peak runs up to 12,
          185 feet. The west slope of this range
          contains the headwaters of the Yel
          lowstone river. The south boundary
          runs along Buffalo fork to the Snake
          river at Jackson lake. The west line
          runs nlong the Teton range. Included
          In the addition are Jackson lake.
          Grand Teton (13,741) and Mount Mo
          ran (12,100). Grand Teton has been
          a famous landmark since the early
          days of the fur trade and Jackson
          Hole was the last refuge of organized
          bad men, cattle rustlers and horse
          ' ' ~ '
          thieves. It wns unknown land when
          Yellowstone was established In 1872.
          The Jnckson Hole elk herd Is an en
          tirely different herd from that of Yel
          lowstone. It Is supposed to number
          about 15,000 head. As nntlonnl parks
          upon establishment automatically be
          come wild animal life sanctuaries, en
          largement of Yellowstone would save
          the herd.
          The uddition of the Jackson Hole
          country will work many changes In
          Yellowstone. A planned feature Is an
          automobile liighwuy from Moran to the
          Cody road, around the east side of
          Yellowstone lake, thus making a third
          loop. A hotel will be established on

          good nnd the example has heen fol
          lowed by many nations, with others

          OIXG to "Colter's Hell" this sum-,
          nier? If so, be sure to take with
          you Uncle Sam's 1020 bulletin, just
          off the government press. It tells
          you all about "Colter's Hell"
          which is to say, the Yellowstone,
          oldest and most famous of our 19
          national parks.
          Why "Colter's Hell"? Well, It's
          an interesting story and not every
          one knows it. The story of John Colter and "Col
          ter's llell" properly begins away back In 180o,
          when Thomas Jefferson, our third president,
          bought the Louisiana territory from Napoleon
          Bonavmrte.
          The western boundary of the United States
          was then the Mississippi, as fixed by the treaty
          with Great Britain after the Involution. Jeffer
          son sent James Monroe to France to co-oirerate
          with Minister Robert It. Livingston in the pur
          chase of the Mississippi's mouth for $2,000,XH).'
          Napoleon laughed at them, lie had just made
          Spain cede him the Louisiana Territory, Intend
          ing to establish there an empire to replace that
          lost to the British In Canada. Then Napoleon saw
          be must fight the British. He could not fight and
          colonize, too. So, to spite the British, he told the
          two Americans they could have all the country
          between the Mississippi and the Itockies (Texas
          not included) for $15,(XK),000. And he made Mon
          roe and Livingston agree. Jefferson was scared
          stiff at the act of his agents. There was a nation
          wide rumpus over the purchase, but congress rati
          fied it and the people finally approved it.
          Jefferson had not the slightest idea what the
          United States had bought and in the spring of 1S04
          ho started the Lewis and Clark expedition from St.
          Louis to find out Tills famous expedition went to
          the mouth of the Columbia river and returned to
          St. Louis in lSOG, after having been given, up for
          lost. It passed a few miles to the north of the
          Yellowstone, without even suspecting its existence.
          John Colter was one of the private soldiers of
          the exiedltioii. Before it reached St. Louis he got
          his discharge and returned with two trappers to
          the headwaters of the Missouri for beaver. In the
          firing of 1S07 at the mouth of the Platte be met
          Manuel Lisa and . again turned back. Lisa built
          Fort Lisa at the confluence of tlfe Yellowstone and
          the Big Horn. Colter, going alone to summon the
          Crows lo (lie fort for trade, passed to the south of
          tlie Yellowstone tltrough Jackson's Hole to Tierre's
          Hole at the west of the Yellowstone. Returning
          thence to Fort Lisa, he passed diagonally through
          the Yellowstone, the first white man to see its won
          ders. Colter, after adventures and travels that give
          him a front rank among explorers of the west, re
          turned to St. Louis in 1S10. lie recounted his ad
          ventures and lie told of the marvels of the Yellow
          stone. St. Louis believed some of his tales of ad
          venture, but would have none of the geysers, boil
          ing springs and paint-pots of the Yellowstone.
          They derisively dubbed it "Colter's Hell," laughed
          over it for a time and then forgot it. Gen. Wil
          liam Clark, his commander, was the only one to
          believe him. On the oflicial map of the Lewis and
          Clark expedition Is a dotted line from Fort Lisa
          to the Yellowstone and return, with the legend,
          "Colter's route in 1807."
          The Yellowstone v'as discovered the second
          time about 1S27 this time by Jim Bridger, one of
          (Jen. William 11. Ashley's lieutenants In the Rocky
          Mountain Fur company. Bridger was the discov
          erer of Great Salt Lake, a map-maker without an
          equal, a mountaineer, plainsman and guide with
          no superior. But he had a hobby big yarns. It
          is he who made up those classic "whoppers" of
          the west the obsidian cliff, boiling spring, echo
          and alum creek stories. So, when he told about
          the wonders of the Yellowstone, u scoffing frontier
          said, with laughter: "Oh, just another of Jim
          Bridgor's yarns."
          Warren Angus Fenis described the Upper Gey
          ser basin of the Yellowstone in 1S-12 and was not
          believed. Prospectors in the Montana gold excite
          ment of 1802 again described the Yellowstone; they
          were set down as liars. Newspapers and maga
          zines would not publish the stories; lecturers were
          stoned. Iu 1809 the semi-official Montana Wash-burn-Langford
          expedition did succeed in getting a
          hearing. In 1870 the federal government sent an
          official exjied It ion which official ly put Mie Yellow
          stone on the map.
          Cornelius Hedges, September 18, 1S70, by a
          campflre In the Yellowstone, proposed that the
          wonderland be niado a national park a pluy-
          ground set aside for the people's use forever. The
          idea took. Congress established the Yellowstone
          National park, March 1, 1872.
          The establishment of the Yellowstone as a na
          tional park after 05 years of "discoveries" was
          the first time such a thing had been done In all
          history. It was the first national park in all the
          world. The United States set the example which
          practically all the civilized world has followed.
          Uncle Sam's 1920 Yellowstone Bulletin is a
          fascinating booklet of 103 pages of text, maps
          and illustrations. It contains everything that the
          tourist needs to know, from how to get there to 0
          time table of the geysers and from the different
          kinds of trout to the automobile regulations. The
          following items are taken from the introductory
          pages :
          The Yellowstone National park was created by
          the act of March 1, 1872. It is approximately G2
          miles long and 54 miles wide, giving an area of
          3.348 square miles, or 2,142,720 acres. It Is under
          the control and supervision of the national park
          service of the Interior department.
          The Yellowstone is probably the best known of
          our national parks. Its geysers are celebrated the
          world over because, for size, power, and variety
          of action, as well as number, the region has no
          competitor.
          The Yellowstone National park is located in
          northwestern Wyoming, encroaching slightly upon
          Montana and Idaho. It is our largest national
          park. The central portion Is essentially a broad,
          elevated, volcanic plateau, between 7,000 and 8,500
          feet above st-a level and with an average elevation
          of about 8,000 feet. Surrounding ft on the south,
          east, north, and northwest are mountain ranges
          with culminating peaks and ridges rising from
          2,000 to 4,000 feet above the general level of the
          inclosed tableland.
          The entire region is volcanic. Not only the sur
          rounding mountains but the great interior plain
          is made of material once ejected, as ash and lava,
          from depths far below the surface. Geological
          speculation points to a crater which doubtless once
          opened just west of Mount Washburn.
          There are five active geyser basins, the Norris,
          the Lower, the Upper, the Heart lake, and Sho
          shone basins, all lying In the wesMind south cen
          tral parts of the park. The geysers exhibit a large
          variety of character and action. Some, like Old
          Faithful, spout at quite regular Intervals, longer
          or shorter. Others are irregular. Some burst up
          ward with immense power. Others shoot streams
          at angles or bubble anil foam In action.
          Geysers arc. roughly speaking, water volca
          noes. They occur only at places where the Inter
          nal heat of the earth approaches close to the sur
          face. Their action, for so many years unex
          plained, and even now regarded with wonder by
          so many. Is simple. Water from the surface trick
          ling through crack In the rocks, or water from
          subterranean springs collecting in the bottom of
          the geyser's crater, down among the strata of in
          tense heat, becomes Itself Intensely heated and
          gives off steam, which expands and forces upward
          the cooler water that lies above It.
          At last the water in the bottom reaches so
          great an expansion under continued heat that the
          less: heated water above can no longer weigh It
          down, so it hursts upward with great violence,
          rising many feet in the air and continuing to play
          until practically all the water In the crater has
          been expelled.
          Nearly the entire Yellowstone region Is remark
          able for its hot water phenomena. The more
          prominent geysers are confined to three basins
          lying near each other In the middle west side of
          the park, but other hot water manifestations oc
          cur nt more widely separated points. Marvelous
          ly colored hot springs, mud volcanoes, and other
          strange phenomena are frequent. At Mammoth,
          at Norris, and at Thumb the hot water lias
          lrought to the surface quantities of white min
          eral deposits which build terraces of beautifully
          incrusted basins high up into the air, often en
          gulfing trees of considerable size. Over the edges'
          of these carved basins pours the hot water. Mi
          croscopic plants called algae grow on the edges
          and sides of these basins, painting them hues of
          red and pink and bluish gray, which glow bril
          liantly. At many other points lesser hot spring
          occur, introducing strange, almost uncanny, ele
          ments into wooded and otherwise quite normal
          landscapes.
          The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone affords
          a spectacle worthy of a national park were there
          no geysers. Standing upon Inspiration Point,
          which pushes out almost to the center of tle can
          yon, one seems to look almost vertically down
          upon the foaming Yellowstone river. To the south
          a waterfall twice the height of Niagara rustics
          seemingly out of the pine-clad hills and pours
          downward to be lost again in green. From that
          point two .or three miles to where you stand and
          beneath you widens out the most glorious kaleido.
          scope of color you will ever see in nature. The
          steep slopes, dropping on either side 1,000 feet and
          more from the pine-topped levels above, are incon
          ceivably carved and fretted by the frost and the
          erosion of the ages.
          The fossil forests of the YellowstoneNatlon.il
          park cover an extensive area in the northern por
          tion of the park, being especially abundant along
          the west side of Lamar river for about 20 miles
          above its junction with the Yellowstone. One
          traversing the valley of the Lamar river may see
          at many places numerous upright fossil trunks in
          the faces of nearly vertical walls. These trunks
          are not all at a particular level hut occur at Irreg
          ular heights; in fact a section cut down through
          these 2,000 feet of beds would disclose a succes
          sion of fossil forests. That is to say, after the
          first forest grew and was entombed, there was a
          time without volcanic outburst a period long
          enougli to permit a second forest to grow above
          the first. Tliis In turn was covered by volcanic
          material and preserved, to.be followed again by a
          period of quiet, and these more or less regular al
          ternations of volcanlsm and forest growth contin
          ued throughout the time the beds were iu process
          of formation.
          The Yellowstone National park Is . the largest
          and most succesNful wild animal refuge In the
          world. It Is also, for this reason, the best and
          most accessible field for nature study. Its. 3.300
          square miles of mountains and valleys remain
          nearly as nature made them, for the 2HJ miles of
          roads and the four hotels and many camps are as
          nothing in this immense wilderness. No tree has
          been cut except when absolutely necessary for
          road or trail or camp. No herds Invade Its val
          leys. Visitors for the most part keep to the beat
          en road, and the wild animals have learned in the
          years that they mean them no barm. To be sure
          they are not always seen by the ioople In the
          automobile stages which whirl from point to point
          dally during the season; but the quiet watcher on
          the trails may see deer and bear and elk and an
          telope to his heart's content, and he may even see
          mountain sheep, moose, and bison by journeying
          on foot or by horseback into their distant retreats.
          It is an excellent bird preserve also; 20U spe
          cies live natural, undisturbed lives. Eagles aro
          found among the crags.
          Trout fishing in Yellowstone waters Is unex
          celled. All three of the great watersheds abound
          in trout, which often attain large size. Yellow
          stone lake is. t lie home of large trout, which are
          taken freely from boats, and the Yellowstone riv
          er and Its tributaries yield excellent catches to the
          skillful angler.
          The criticism often made by persons who have
          visited granite countries that the Yellowstone re
          gion lacks the supreme grandeur of some others
          of our national parks will cease to have weight
          when the magnificent Teton mountains just south
          of the soiflhern boundary are added to the park.
          These mountains begin at the foot of the Pitch
          stone plateau a mile or two below the southern
          gateway and extend south and west. They bor
          der Jackson lake on its west side, rising rapidly
          in a series of remarkably toothed and Jagged peaks
          until they reach a sublime climax, 30 miles south
          of the park, in the Grand Teton, which rises cathedral-like
          to nn altitude of 13,747 feet. ,
          These amazing mountains are, from their na
          ture, a component part of the Yellowstone Na
          tional park, whose gamut of majestic scenery they
          complete, and no doubt would have been Included
          within its original boundaries had their supremo
          magnificence been then appreciated. Already Yel
          lowstone visitors have claimed It, and nutomohllo
          stages run to Moran and back on regular schedule.
          In time, no doubt, part of it will be added forumlly
          to the park territory.

          would believe when he first reported his miraculous "find" is shown in the
          upper right. Jim died years ago, but the bear here shown lives on, and
          will help golden anniversary year tourists in their vindication of the old
          trapper's wondrous yarns at the gala fiftieth year. Below is one of the
          big park busses, being loaded at Old Faithful camp.
          There
          Imagine the hard luck. With a
          reputation already made as the in
          ventor of many a fanciful tale of the
          old west, to really discover a thing
          beyond even his own wildest imagin
          ings, and then to be branded a liar!
          VERSARY OF YEL
          LOWSTONE PARK
          Jim Bridger's Biggest
          Lie Was the
          Truth
          Tears ago old. Jim Bridger was
          one of the earliest travelers of the
          Yellowstone.
          But when he tried to tell of the
          gigantic geysers, rivers that ran
          cold on top and hot on the bottom
          and
          country laughed at him, and he be
          came known as the grtatest liar of
          his time.
          waterfalls, the
          monstrous
          A rough deal,, indeed.
          But 1922 marks the golden anni
          versary of the Yellowstone National
          Park. And this year every traveler
          who goes to the wonderland to help
          ceelbrate the gala year, every deluxe
          train that runs from Salt Lakt City
          to the park entrance at West Yel
          lowstone, will be a vindication for
          poor old Bridger.
          His biggest "lie" was the truth.
          • There have been many changes to
          the Yellowstone since Bridger's day
          as travelers who come this year will
          find. Where he went in overland
          with pack horses, they roll in over
          a steel highway in de luxe trains,
          whose service this year will be
          doubled. In addition to the famous
          "Yellowstone Special" which nightly
          flashes over the rails from Salt Lake
          to the park entrance, there will be
          a daylight train, which will enable
          the visitor to see the scenic moun
          tain wonders of the Targhee forest,
          en route to the park itself.
          Arriving at West Yellowstone,
          more changes are evident. Where
          Bridger went thru the brush, and
          used river beds as trails, this sum
          mer's traveler will find a matchless
          system of highways, with automo
          bile transportation awaiting him.
          He can select any one of half a
          dozen trips thru the wonderland.
          Instead of mountain trails there is a
          system of matchless highways.
          Hotels with every modern comfort
          and convenience await him in the
          heart of the wilderness. Permanent
          camps offer equal comfort and at
          traction. But both hotels and
          camps have been so skillfully con
          structed that their rustic log archi
          tecture adds to the natural wild
          beauty of the whole.
          Thru all this is a wonderful sys
          tem of co-operation between gov
          ernment, railroads, hotels, camps,
          and transportatoin that enables
          100,000 people to se the whole park
          annually. And yet with all these
          changes, so have they been kept to
          the spirit of the place, the park is
          the same old Yellowstone.
          Only one change is the reverse of
          what it seems it should be. The
          animals, wild in Bridger's day, are
          tame now.
          hand.
          lordly heads to watch the bus cara
          vans roll by. Deer pause by the
          roadside and eye them speculatively.
          Mighty rainbow trout leap from the
          river to tempt the anglers.
          Clear and deep, the Yellowstone
          river flows on, unchanged. The
          voice of the falls booms forth in the
          key it used when the moon was
          young, the geysers spout at the
          regular intervals as they did before
          Columbus made his historic first im
          migration to American shores. Deep
          carpets of pine needles, the accumu
          lation of centuries invite rest in the
          shadows of pines that started grow
          ing when the ground first grew cool.
          Unusual activity is promised for
          the geysers this year. The snow
          fall was adbnormally heavy last
          winter, and the moisture which will
          make the falls and cascades of un
          usual beauty will add to the sensa
          tional performances of boiling
          springs, geysers and mud pots.
          Even nature has assisted, this
          year, in the vindication of Jim
          Bridger's suspected tongue, and the
          stage is set for a wonderful opening
          of the park's fiftieth anniversary.
